                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-git-version-control"><strong>Git</strong></a>
                    is a distributed version control system, meaning that it allows
                    developers to work on their own local copies of a project, while still
                    enabling them to push changes to a shared repository.It was created by
                    <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> in <em>2005</em>, and has been
                    maintained by <strong>Junio Hamano</strong> since then.

                <h3>What Is Git Version Control?</h3>
                <p>
                    Git as a
                    <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-git-version-control/"><strong>version control system
                            (VCS)</strong></a>, it helps developers track changes, manage multiple versions of
                    code, and collaborate efficiently. It is widely used in software
                    development to ensure smooth teamwork and maintain a structured
                    history of modifications.
                </p>
                <h3>What is Version Control?</h3>
                <p>
                    Version control is a system that tracks changes made to files over
                    time. It allows developers to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Save and track changes: Every modification made to the codebase is
                        recorded.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Revert to previous versions: If something breaks or a feature
                        doesn't work as expected, you can revert to a stable version.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Collaborate: Multiple developers can work on the same project
                        without overwriting each other's work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Branching and Merging: Developers can create branches for different
                        features, work on them independently, and merge them back to the
                        main codebase when ready.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Other Version Control Systems:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Mercurial (Hg) - A distributed version control system similar to
                        Git, known for its simplicity and efficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Subversion (SVN) - A centralized version control system used in
                        enterprise environments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Perforce - A high-performance version control system often used in
                        game development and large-scale projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bazaar - A flexible version control system that supports both
                        distributed and centralized workflows.
                    </li>

                    <p>
                        In this blog, I'll be focusing primarily on Git and GitHub, which
                        are among the most popular tools for version control and
                        collaboration. While other version control systems like Mercurial
                        and Subversion exist, Git stands out due to its wide adoption and
                        integration with platforms like GitHub.

                <p>In this blog we will be covering how to <strong>install Git on windows.</strong> However, it is
                    worth
                    noting that <em>Git is available</em> for <u>Linux</u> and <u>macOS users</u>. Git is a <a

                <h2>Configuring Git</h2>
                <p>Next, configure Git with your identity</p>
                <p>This step is essential because Git uses these details to label each commit you make.</p>
                <ol type="I">
                    <li>
                        <h3>User Name</h3>
                    </li>
                    <p>Your name will be added to each change you save (commit) in Git.</p>
                    <p><span><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> If you make a mistake while typing your name or email, don’t
                        worry! Just type the command again with the right details — this will replace and update the
                        previous one.</p>
                    <p>Set it with the following command.</p>

                    </li>
                    <p>When Git requires you to enter a message for a commit or a merge, it opens a text editor. You can
                        set
                        your preferred editor using:</p>

                    <p>In the command above, code --wait tells Git to open Visual Studio Code as the editor. You can
                        change
                        this to match your favorite editor—like nano, vim, or notepad—depending on what you’re
                        comfortable
                        using.</p>

                <h2>Initializing a Git repository</h2>
                <p>To initialize a git repository:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Navigate to your project folder in the terminal.</li>
                    <li>Initialize Git in the project folder by running:</li><br>
                    <img src="./Assets/git_init.PNG" alt="Git init command">
                    <p>Running this command, Git creates a hidden folder called .git inside your project.</p>
                    <p>This is where Git stores all the information it needs to track your files and history.</p>
                </ol>
                </p>
            </li>

        <div>
            <li>
                <h2>Adding files to the staging area</h2>
                <p>To start tracking files, you need to stage them. This moves the files into a "staging area" before
                    committing them:</p>
                <p>Here are some key commands for staging:</p>

                <ul type="square">
                    <li>git add (file) -> Stage a file</li>
                    <li>git add --all -> Stage all changes</li>
                    <li>git add -A -> Stage all changes</li>
                    <li>git add . -> Stage all changes</li>
                    <li>Git status -> See what is staged</li>
                    <li>git rm --cached (file) -> Unstage a file</li>
                </ul>

        </div>

        <div>
            <li>
                <h2>Committing changes</h2>
                <p>A <strong>commit</strong> is like a save point in your project.</p>
                <p>It records a snapshot of your files at a certain time, with a message describing what changed.</p>
                <p>You commit by running the following command:</p>
                <img src="./Assets/git_commit_1.PNG" alt="Git commit">
                <h3>Write Multi-line Commit Messages</h3>
                <p>You can write multi-line commit messages. If you just type <em>git commit</em> (no -m), your default
                    editor will open so you can write a detailed, multi-line message</p>
                <p>For my case, running <em>git commit</em> opens up <em>Visual Studio</em> for writing a detailed
                    commit
                    message.</p>
                <img src="./Assets/git_commit_2.PNG" alt="Git commit">
                <h3>View Commit History (git log)</h3>
                <p>To view the history of commits for a repository, you can use the git log command:</p>

                <h2>Branches</h2>
                <h3>What is a Git Branch?</h3>
                <p>In Git, a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes and try new ideas without
                    affecting the main project.</p>
                <h3>Why Use Branches?</h3>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Developing a new feature</li>
                    <li>Fixing a bug</li>
                    <li>Experimenting with ideas</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </div>

        <div>
            <li>
                <h2>Creating a branch</h2>
                <p>To create a new branch, run the following command:</p>
                <img src="./Assets/git_branch_1.PNG" alt="Git branch command">
                <p>Now we created a new branch called "songs".</p>
            </li>
        </div>

        <div>
            <li>
                <h2>Viewing all branches</h2>
                <p>To see we have created a branch and list all branches, run the following command:</p>
                <img src="./Assets/git_branch_2.PNG" alt="List all branches">
                <p>The * mark shows the current active position of the branch (HEAD).</p>
            </li>
        </div>

        <div>
            <li>
                <h2>Switching active branches</h2>
                <p><em>checkout</em> and <em>switch</em> is the command used to switch between a branch.</p>
                <img src="./Assets/git_switch.PNG" alt="Git switch command">
                <p><span><strong>NOTE:</strong> </span>We can create and switch to a new branch at the same time.</p>
                <p>To achieve that, run the following command:</p>
                <img src="./Assets/git_switch_2.PNG" alt="Git create switch new branch">
                <p>Here, we have created a new branch and switched to it using a single command. </p>
                <p>Running <em>git branch</em>, we can see that a new branch called music was created and has a * mark
                    besides it showing it's the active branch.</p>
            </li>
        </div>

        <div>
            <li>
                <h2>Merging a branch</h2>
                <p>Merging in Git means combining the changes from one branch into another. This helps bring in your
                    current work into the main branch after working on various changes and features.</p>
                <p>To achieve this, we first switch to the master/main branch. We then merge the desired branch to
                    master/main branch using the following command:</p>
                <img src="./Assets/git_merge.PNG" alt="">
                <h3>Aborting a Merge (git merge --abort)</h3>
                <p>If you run into trouble during a merge (like a conflict you don't want to resolve), you can cancel
                    the merge and go back to how things were before with git merge --abort.</p>
                <img src="./Assets/git_merge_abort.PNG" alt="Abort a merge">

        </div>

        <div>
            <li>
                <h2>Deleting a branch</h2>
                <p>After a successful merge of a branch, when you're done with the branch, you can delete it.</p>
                <img src="./Assets/git_branch_delete.PNG" alt="Delete a branch">
                <p>This deletes the branch named music (if it's already merged).</p>

                <h2>Next steps</h2>
                <p>In this blog we have only the basic of Git. You should find extra resources and tutorials to advance
                    your
                    skills. Here are some of the key area you'd like to look at:</p>
                <h3>Git push operation</h3>
                <p>The git push command is used to push the commits from our local branch to the relevant branch on the
                    remote repository.</p>
                <p>git push -u (remoteName) (branchName)</p>
                <h3>Git clone operation</h3>
                <p>This command is used to clone a remote repository into our local machines.</p>
                <p>git clone (remote url)</p>
                <h3>Git Tagging Operation</h3>

                    with releases (like v1.0.2, v2.1.0) or milestones in the development of a project.</p>
